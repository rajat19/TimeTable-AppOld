faculty absent at last moment-

how to check-
1. attendance of all faculties by 8:20 in the morning
2. if faculty not reached the class, CR should contact through app
3. also provision to mark their absence for a particular duration of time

what to do-
1. app gets notified through any of above condition
2. find the class which the faculty had to take
3. find all teachers which are available for the class
	a. if lab, any free faculty
	b. if class, find faculty teaching that class
4. sort faculty according to following parameters (devise points for each parameter)
	a. no. of free lectures -> more the free lectures that day, more chances of assigning
	b. last lecture free -> if yes, more chances of assigning
	c. next lecture free -> if yes, more chances of assigning
	d. syllabus is complete -> if no, more chances of assigning
5. inform the concerned authority about their lecture
6. inform CR and admin about the faculty
7. check again after period is over, if any faculty is absent

how to inform-
1. automated calls (if free possible)
2. push notifications through app
3. messages (if free)

some more thought-
1. if any faculty for a class is not available, find that faculty which teaches in the class and is currently in lab
2. provide ranking system as explained above to allot class
